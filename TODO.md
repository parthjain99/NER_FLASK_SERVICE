1. API Development:

- Develop a Flask application with a set of API endpoints that interact with a MySQL database and an AI service/
  model.
- Implement RESTful principles in API development, ensuring endpoints are well-structured and intuitive.

2. Database Integration:

- Design and implement a MySQL database schema relevant to the application's functionality (e.g., storing user data,
  AI inputs/outputs).
- Implement CRUD operations through the API to interact with the database.

3. AI Integration:

- Integrate an external AI API or a Python AI library to process data. For example, use an NLP library to analyze text
  data or an image processing library for image data.
- Ensure the AI component is modular and interacts with the rest of the application through well-defined interfaces.

4. Authentication and Authorization:

- Implement basic authentication and authorization to secure the API endpoints. Consider using Flask extensions like
  Flask-HTTPAuth or Flask-JWT.

5. Error Handling and Logging:

- Develop robust error handling to manage and respond to exceptions gracefully.
- Implement logging to track the application's behavior and potential issues.

6. Testing:

- Write unit and integration tests for your API endpoints and business logic.
- Ensure tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.

7. Documentation:

- Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman. Provide clear instructions on how to interact
  with the API.
- Include a README file in the GitHub repository with:
- Detailed setup and run instructions for the Flask application.
- An overview of the API endpoints and their functionalities.
- Information on the AI integration and how it's used within the application.

8. GitHub Repository:

- Push your application code to a public GitHub repository.
- Ensure the repository includes all necessary files (excluding virtual environments and sensitive credentials) and
  instructions for setting up and running the application.
